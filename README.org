* [[./android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png]] piggybudget - easily manage your pocket money
** What is it, in bullet points?

- It’s a tiny app that I wrote for myself to keep track of my expenses.
- There’s *two buttons*
  - You received some money (you got paid, somebody owed you some, …)
  - You spent money
- You can select one of 13 *categories* when receiving money
- You can specify a daily or monthly amount – your “pocket money”. This will be added to your account automatically.
- You can select a *currency*. Euro is the default currency.
- There are *statistics* about how you spend your money.
- There’s a *history* for viewing your expenses one by one.

Happy saving!
